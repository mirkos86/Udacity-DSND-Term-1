    "\n",
    "In this project, you will apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data that you will use has been provided by our partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will help you complete this task by providing a framework within which you will perform your analysis steps. In each step of the project, you will see some text describing the subtask that you will perform, followed by one or more code cells for you to complete your work. **Feel free to add additional code and markdown cells as you go along so that you can explore everything in precise chunks.** The code cells provided in the base template will outline only the major tasks, and will usually not be enough to cover all of the minor tasks that comprise it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that while there will be precise guidelines on how you should handle certain tasks in the project, there will also be places where an exact specification is not provided. **There will be times in the project where you will need to make and justify your own decisions on how to treat the data.** These are places where there may not be only one way to handle the data. In real-life tasks, there may be many valid ways to approach an analysis task. One of the most important things you can do is clearly document your approach so that other scientists can understand the decisions you've made.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of most sections, there will be a Markdown cell labeled **Discussion**. In these cells, you will report your findings for the completed section, as well as document the decisions that you made in your approach to each subtask. **Your project will be evaluated not just on the code used to complete the tasks outlined, but also your communication about your observations and conclusions at each stage.**"

You will use this information to cluster the general population into groups with similar demographic properties. Then, you will see how the people in the customers dataset fit into those created clusters. The hope here is that certain clusters are over-represented in the customers data, as compared to the general population; those over-represented clusters will be assumed to be part of the core userbase. This information can then be used for further applications, such as targeting for a marketing campaign.\n",

    "To start off with, load in the demographics data for the general population into a pandas DataFrame, and do the same for the feature attributes summary. Note for all of the `.csv` data files in this project: they're semicolon (`;`) delimited, so you'll need an additional argument in your [`read_csv()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html) call to read in the data properly. Also, considering the size of the main dataset, it may take some time for it to load completely.\n",

Directly from customers over the years, for instance by asking them to fill some necessary forms to initiate the commercial relationship; beside basic and necessary information, the company may have asked some non mandatory questions like birth year which have helped it identify features not directly related to the customer, like the birth date of the head of the household. The voluntary nature of one's birth year or the head-of-household's birth date disclosure make the data mining process harder, explaining why they are a bit defective. Beside, the fact that the amounts of missing data on these two features is comparable, is an indication that a persona inclined to disclose one is roughly equally inclined to disclose the other. \n",

Following up on this, the company may have put some data mining effort analysing and cross linking and checking data on neighborhoods or data on purchase patterns from the company itself to extract more qualitative features such as type of ager and consumer patterns in the past 12 months. The fact that the amount of missing data for these two features is comparable suggests that there is a correlation between them; secondly, they are also harder to mine, since more than 65% of entries is missing from both; finally, ager type is the more defective one, presumably because purchase patterns are often not informative enough, either because customers seldom purchase something or because the purchased goods are not distinctive enough. \n",

    "3. Availability of information about the most common building type in the microcell is practically a coin toss, with roughly 50% of data being available. Since, however, for all other features about microcells more than 80% of data is collected, this is likely a problem of averaging and time-dependence: it is often possible to qualify the most common types of family homes in the neighborhood in terms of number of inhabitants, but selecting the most common one can be hard for a few reasons: defining the precise borders of such a microcell (averaging) and being sure that people haven't left their families to live elsewhere (or are going to do so soon) and that newborns are unlikely to arrive/are arriving soon (time dependence). In such cases, the data engineer's conservative choice to declare uncertainty in the form of missing data may be less biasing than selecting a feebly standing option.\n"

Since the unsupervised learning techniques to be used will only work on data that is encoded numerically, you need to make a few encoding changes or additional assumptions to be able to make progress. In addition, while almost all of the values in the dataset are encoded using numbers, not all of them represent numeric values. Check the third column of the feature summary (`feat_info`) for a summary of types of measurement.\n",
    "- For numeric and interval data, these features can be kept without changes.\n",
    "- Most of the variables in the dataset are ordinal in nature. While ordinal values may technically be non-linear in spacing, make the simplifying assumption that the ordinal variables can be treated as being interval in nature (that is, kept without any changes).\n",
    "- Special handling may be necessary for the remaining two variable types: categorical, and 'mixed'.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first two parts of this sub-step, you will perform an investigation of the categorical and mixed-type features and make a decision on each of them, whether you will keep, drop, or re-encode each. Then, in the last part, you will create a new data frame with only the selected and engineered columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data wrangling is often the trickiest part of the data analysis process, and there's a lot of it to be done here. But stick with it: once you're done with this step, you'll be ready to get to the machine learning parts of the project!"

So, before applying the scaler to your data, make sure that you've cleaned the DataFrame of the remaining missing values. This can be as simple as just removing all data points with missing data, or applying an [Imputer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.Imputer.html) to replace all missing values. You might also try a more complicated procedure where you temporarily remove missing values in order to compute the scaling parameters before re-introducing those missing values and applying imputation. Think about how much missing data you have and what possible effects each approach might have on your analysis, and justify your decision in the discussion section below.\n",

Don't forget to keep the fit sklearn objects handy, since you'll be applying them to the customer demographics data towards the end of the project."

    "> Congratulations on making it this far in the project! Before you finish, make sure to check through the entire notebook from top to bottom to make sure that your analysis follows a logical flow and all of your findings are documented in **Discussion** cells. Once you've checked over all of your work, you should export the notebook as an HTML document to submit for evaluation. You can do this from the menu, navigating to **File -> Download as -> HTML (.html)**. You will submit both that document and this notebook for your project submission."
