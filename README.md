# udacity-data-science-projects

Supervised, deep and unsupervised learning projects I have completed to get my Udacity ML Nanodegree "Intro to Machine Learning with Pytorch".
Pytorch is actually used only in the deep learning proejct on image classification. 
Large data files for the unsupervised learning projest "cluster_customers" are uploaded via git lfs (Large File Storage), 
an open source project available at https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs.

Specifications for the single projects are availale ithin their respective Jupyter notebooks.
