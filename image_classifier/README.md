# Data Scientist Project

This is the Deep Learning project I completed in order to get started with deep Neural Networks. 
Disclaimer: I tweaked the classifier of the Pytorch vg166 NN to start off, I did not create my own convolutional Neral Network from scratch.

This code was actually run on a Udacity workspace provided with a GPU, for it is highly inefficient if used with just an ordinary CPU.
Actually, I cannot even load the full dataset here on GitHub, but it can be downloaded at 
https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html, 
then put into the same folder as the rest of the code.
