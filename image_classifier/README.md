# Data Scientist Project

This is the Deep Learning project I completed in order to get started with deep Neural Networks (not my own, I tweaked a pre-trained one for a start).

This code was actually run on a Udacity workspace provided with a GPU,
for it is highly inefficient if used with just an ordinary CPU.
Actually, I cannot even load the full dataset hereon GitHub,
ut I am experimenting a lot with git and GitHub as well, 
so it is good practice anyway.
